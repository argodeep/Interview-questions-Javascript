# Daily-Coding-Problem-Solution
This is a  repo where I will try to solve Daily-Coding-Problem solution asked by different company across the world.
Mostly I will try to solve them via JavaScript and few of them by python/C++ etc(You can ask for any language you want).

I will happy to know your suggestions/more optimized solution e.g. less runtime etc.

I intent is to solve these problems like we are in interview scenario.
In an interview coming with a minimal answer (may not be most optimal solution) is more important than stuck yourself in finding the best optimal solution.

So with that thought I am trying to solve these problem which will be like first idea/solution arise in our mind after saw any problem.

*Tips
