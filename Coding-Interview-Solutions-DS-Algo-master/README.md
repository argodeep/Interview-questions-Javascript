Here in this repo you will get coding interview solutions from different companies like google, Facebook etc.

1. Return the first recurring character from a given string - CS dojo Google Engineer.
	 - `Input - 'ABCAB'` and `Output - 'A'`
   - Explantion > first recurring character is A.
2. Return the no of pair that matches the given sum from a collection of numbers -  Life at Google.
   - `Input  - 1, 2, 3, 4 and sum 6` and `Output - 1`
   - Explantion > 4 + 2 is equal to 6. Only 1 pair.
3. Given two array unsorted array e.g. `[1, 2, 4, 6]` and `[5, 8, 9, 10]`.
   - Output a single array from them in sorted manner. E.g. `[1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10]` without using spread operator, array sort & concat mehtod.
4. Find the index of an value in a sorted array using binary search e.g. `[1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 27]` using recursive function.
   - Output the index and if not present then show -1. E.g. for the above value array index is `6`
5. Asked in Google Coding Interview Difficulty level medium. Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string. Input : `s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"` Output : `True` Explanation s2 contains permutation of s1 `ba`. Input : `s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"` Output : `False`
